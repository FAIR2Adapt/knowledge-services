# Template for Formulating Dashboards
 

<!-- ## 1. Summary of Dashboard Requirements and Corresponding Images -->
The FAIR2Adapt project aim to develop the different user-facing knowledge services, this section outlines the initial requirment for services/dashboard design, which demonstrates the desired stakeholder requirements, including a high-level overview of the main features and visual mockups. The inital description inclusinfg required fetuers description, dashbord mokup and some description table related to required resources for providing the target knowledge services.
The dashboard image serves as a prototype or a mockup, providing a visual representation. By using this method, the extraction of technical knowledge and the identification of technical requirements for providing a knowledge-publishing dashboard can be accelerated.

Several categories of services can be used, considering the primary goal of the dashboard is to publish knowledge and leverage available framework APIs like ROHAB, the services have been categorized under Knowledge Service Categories. The  the first category of services focuses on functionality, aiming to addressing "Data Publishing and Retrieval", and second category, "Composite Services", involves making calls to available services, including those from third parties, to create more complex and integrated functionalities.



This section outlines the requirements for the dashboard. It includes a high-level overview of the main features and visual mockups to provide a clear understanding of the final product.

### Services/Dashbord Requirements:
- **Description**: _Briefly outlines the requirements for the dashboard and how this view addresses the stakeholderâ€™s need._
- **Dashboard View**:   _Dashbord Images for expected pages_
- **Table description for Target users**:   _Briefly outlines target users(e.g. Researchers, Policymakers)_
- **Table description for Service functinality and resources**:   _Briefly outlines target users(e.g. Researchers, Policymakers)_

## 1. Featuers Description of Services

## 2. Resources feeding Dashboard/Services 

This description is important , considering for desining publishing or retriving knowledge services the resourses are required

- Multiresources Pool
- Private/Public Links
- Public API Specification Link of resources
- Retrival APIs list
- Private/Public List of resources/content in csv or Excel

## 3. Interacting with avalible F2A APIs 
- For example Retrival APIs using [ROHub](https://www.rohub.org/)

## 4.Dashboard Pages Mockups
The dashboard mockup requires a visual representation of a dashboard's layout, structure, and key elements. It includes components like the navigation menu, data tables, plots, and filters. Mockups are used in the design process to plan the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) before development process.

## 5. Target Users

This section identifies the intended users for the service knowledge and dashboard, clarifying who will be using it and for what purpose.


| Role Based Access Control     | Stakeholders Sample                          | Asset Access Level                  | Resource                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public / Unauthenticated User** | Non-Experts / Citizens<br>Researchers<br>Organizations |  - Public <br> -Sensitive data from city authorities and local stakeholders                          |                      links                                                    |

## 6. List of API Services

This section need to provides required table description of the different types of API services in the dashbord.
